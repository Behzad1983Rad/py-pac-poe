Py-Pac-Poe
Py-Pac-Poe is a simple command-line based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python. It allows players to compete against each other until one player reaches a specified number of wins.

Features
Play Tic-Tac-Toe against another player on the same computer.
Keep track of scores for multiple games until one player reaches a specified number of wins.
Simple command-line interface for ease of use.


How to Play
The game is played on a 3x3 grid.
Players take turns placing their mark (X or O) in an empty cell.
The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
If all cells are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a tie.

My Py-Pac-Poe was implemented using classes instead of functions for educational purposes. Here's why:
Learning Experience: Using classes provided an opportunity to learn about object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in Python. By structuring the game logic into a class, it allowed for better organization and encapsulation of related data and functionality.
Code Reusability: Classes promote code reusability by allowing you to create multiple instances (objects) of the same class with different state and behavior. In the context of Py-Pac-Poe, this means that the game logic can be reused and extended for future projects or modifications.
